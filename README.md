# üó∫Ô∏è Pathfinding Visualizer With Real-Time Map Data

#### Explore and compare different pathfinding algorithms on a map of Bangalore city. 
- A GUI interface that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms on a real-time map of Bangalore city. 
- It allows users to see how algorithms like BFS, DFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and A-Star find paths across a real-world map.

# Keyboard Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| C | Enable Compare Paths mode ‚Äî lets you cycle through and compare different algorithms‚Äô paths. |
| ‚Üë (Up Arrow) | Cycle backward through available algorithms in Compare Paths mode. |
| ‚Üì (Down Arrow) | Cycle forward through available algorithms in Compare Paths mode. |


## Usage

- Select the pathfinding algorithm you want to use from the menu.
- Click on the map to set the start and end points (red and green location markers).
- Watch as the algorithm finds the shortest path on the map.
- Press C on the keyboard to compare the performance(time & distance) of different algorithms in real-time
