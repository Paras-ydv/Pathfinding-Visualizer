# üó∫Ô∏è Bangalore Pathfinding Visualizer

#### Explore and compare different pathfinding algorithms on a map of Bangalore city. 
- A GUI interface that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms on a real-time map of Bangalore city. 
- It allows users to see how algorithms like BFS, DFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and A-Star find paths across a real-world map.

---

## Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implementations of BFS, DFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and A-Star.
- **Interactive Map**: Real-time rendering of the map and paths.
- **Vehicle Movement**: Simulated movement along the computed path.
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare different paths and their statistics (distance and time).
- **Visual Elements**: Roads, buildings, and natural elements are clearly marked.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/R-Anurag/Map-Implementation-Path-Finding-Algorithms.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the visualizer: `python main.py`

---

## Usage

- Select the pathfinding algorithm you want to use from the menu.
- Click on the map to set the start and end points (red and green location markers).
- Watch as the algorithm finds the shortest path on the map.
- Press C on the keyboard to compare the performance(time & distance) of different algorithms in real-time
