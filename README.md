# 🗺️ Bangalore Pathfinding Visualizer

#### Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer repository! Explore and compare different pathfinding algorithms on a map of Bangalore city. 🌟🗺️

### **You should be aware:-** 
- *First Load*: When you load the visualizer for the first time, it's like a map unfolding in front of you. 🌍 It might take a moment as the data loads in (this is just how map visualizations function).
- *Subsequent operations*: Once the data is cached, subsequent functioning will be swift, bringing the map and pathfinding algorithms to life in an instant. 🚀

## Introduction

The Bangalore Pathfinding Visualizer is a tool that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms on a map of Bangalore city. It allows users to see how algorithms like BFS, DFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and A-Star find paths across a real-world map.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bangalore-pathfinding-visualizer.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the visualizer: `python main.py`

## Usage

- Select the pathfinding algorithm you want to use from the menu.
- Click on the map to set the start and end points.
- Watch as the algorithm finds the shortest path on the map.
- Press C on the keyboard to compare the performance(time & distance) of different algorithms in real-time

## Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implementations of BFS, DFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and A-Star.
- **Interactive Map**: Real-time rendering of the map and paths.
- **Vehicle Movement**: Simulated movement along the computed path.
- **Comparison Mode**: Compare different paths and their statistics (distance and time).
- **Visual Elements**: Roads, buildings, and natural elements are clearly marked.
